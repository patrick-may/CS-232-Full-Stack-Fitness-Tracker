# Project: CRUD Lifter

## Description
This is a gym tracking and management software. It currently supports tracking various powerlifting workouts from the perspective of the user and the machine.

It lets one add workouts to their profile, update prior misinformation, and delete workouts if needed. It will (in short future) support a simple history of past workouts. (In further future) it will support querying specific records for information such as max weight, volume, reps, etc. 

To a gym owner, it will allow them to view information about usage of machines, and eventually support more specific usage queries.
