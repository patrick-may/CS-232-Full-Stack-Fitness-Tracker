# Project: CRUD Lifter

## Description
This is a gym tracking and management software. It currently supports tracking various powerlifting workouts from the perspective of the user.

It lets one add workouts to their profile, update prior misinformation, and delete workouts if needed. Workouts are a collection of weight sets, along with some overall information about the workout. Individual weight sets are able to be edited as desired within the workout.

To a gym owner, it allows them to view, create, update, and delete members that hold accounts in their gym tracking software. 

## API Documentation

Individual weight set CRUD is frowned upon, and relates into the database worse that workouts. 
The API will thus support: Create, Read, Update, Delete of gym members
                        Create, Read, (Update), Delete of workouts,
                        Reading of Individual Weight Sets
